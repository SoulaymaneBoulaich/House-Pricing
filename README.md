## 📊 Overview

This project conducts an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of residential property data to uncover the key factors influencing house prices. Through statistical analysis and compelling visualizations, we examine relationships between property features, quality ratings, and sale prices to provide actionable insights for real estate stakeholders.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Price Distribution Analysis**: Understand the spread and patterns of house sale prices
- **Feature Correlation**: Identify which property features most strongly influence pricing
- **Quality Assessment**: Examine the relationship between overall quality and market value
- **Temporal Trends**: Analyze how construction year impacts property values

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The analysis focuses on key features from the housing dataset:

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| `SalePrice` | Property sale price (target variable) | Numeric |
| `OverallQual` | Overall material and finish quality (1-10) | Ordinal |
| `GrLivArea` | Above grade living area (sq ft) | Numeric |
| `GarageCars` | Garage capacity (number of cars) | Numeric |
| `TotalBsmtSF` | Total basement area (sq ft) | Numeric |
| `YearBuilt` | Original construction year | Numeric |

## ✨ Features

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SoulaymaneBoulaich
/house-price-analysis.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd house-price-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manual Installation

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Execution

```python
# Run the complete analysis
python house_price_analysis.py
```

### Custom Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
from house_price_analysis import analyze_prices

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Run analysis on specific features
features = ['SalePrice', 'OverallQual', 'GrLivArea']
results = analyze_prices(data, features)
```

> **Note**: Ensure `train.csv` is located in the project root directory.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- 📈 **Strong Correlations**: OverallQual and GrLivArea show significant positive correlation with SalePrice
- 🏗️ **Quality Premium**: Higher quality ratings command substantially higher prices
- 📏 **Size Matters**: Living area demonstrates linear relationship with property value
- 🕰️ **Age Factor**: Newer constructions generally command higher prices, with some vintage exceptions
- 🚗 **Garage Impact**: Garage capacity positively influences sale price
